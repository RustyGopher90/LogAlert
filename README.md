# LogAlert

### Who is this application for:
If you are a business with a private network and want to send emails anonymously this app is for you. You must have a smtp server set up.
 
### Usage:
- This App allows you to monitor any log file on windows or linux. Just configure the config.json file and build the exe. 
- Note: This is only set up for anonymous email inside a domain with an smtp server.  I will be working on an option for out of band emails later when I have time.
